    <h1>South Boston's Best Cream Pie</h1>
    <img src="/images/creampie.jpeg" alt="a cream pie" />
    <h2>This is a deluxe gourmet cream pie from South Boston</h2>
    <p>
      This decadent Boston cream pie is a classic American Cake, not pie, made
      with tender vanilla sponge cake filled with silky vanilla pastry cream all
      topped by a glossy chocolate ganache.
    </p>
    <p>
      This classic cake combines three simple components to make one fabulous
      dessert; moist delicate vanilla cake filled with silky vanilla pastry
      cream and topped by a decadent chocolate ganache. If you’re confused as to
      why this “pie” looks like a cake, you’re not alone, cakes used to be baked
      in pie tins!

    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place an egg separator over a small bowl. Crack open 1 egg over the egg
        separator to seperate the yolk from the white; then separate the other
        egg. (Save the whites for another recipe.) In a small bowl, place the
        yolks. Beat the egg yolks with a fork or wire whisk until mixed. Stir in
        1 1/2 cups milk; set aside.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        In a 2-quart saucepan, stir 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the cornstarch and
        1/8 teaspoon salt until mixed. Gradually stir egg mixture into sugar
        mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
        thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in 2
        teaspoons vanilla. Press plastic wrap on surface of filling to prevent a
        tough layer from forming on top. Refrigerate at least 2 hours until set
        but no longer than 24 hours. While filling is chilling, continue with
        recipe.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 350°F. Spray just the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan
        with baking spray with flour.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat all cake ingredients with an electric mixer on low
        speed 30 seconds, stopping frequently to scrape batter from side and
        bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat on high speed 3 minutes,
        stopping occasionally to scrape bowl. Pour batter into the pan; use a
        rubber spatula to scrape batter from bowl, spread batter evenly in pan
        and smooth top of batter.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Bake about 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
        out clean. Cool cake in pan on a cooling rack 20 minutes, then remove
        onto cooling rack to finish cooling completely, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        In a 1-quart saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter and the chocolate over
        low heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in 1-cup glass measuring
        cup, microwave the water uncovered on High 15 to 30 seconds or until
        hot. Remove chocolate mixture from heat. Stir in the powdered sugar and
        3/4 teaspoon vanilla. Stir in 3 tablespoons hot water. Stir in
        additional water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until icing is smooth and thin
        enough to spread.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        To split cake horizontally in half, mark middle points around side of
        cake with toothpicks. Using toothpicks as a guide, cut through the cake
        with a long, sharp knife, using a back-and-forth motion. On a serving
        plate, place bottom layer with the cut side up. Spread filling over
        bottom layer. Top with top of cake, cut side down.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Spread glaze over top of cake, using a metal spatula or back of a spoon,
        letting some glaze drizzle down side of cake. Refrigerate uncovered
        until serving. Store any remaining cake covered in the refrigerator.
