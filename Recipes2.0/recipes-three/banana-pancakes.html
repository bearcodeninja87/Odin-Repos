      Which in turn was handed down to him from his great uncle (twice removed).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Mix-</b> Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking
        powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil,
        mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl
        with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK
        if your batter is slightly lumpy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook-</b> Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan
        or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a
        spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden
        brown).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve-</b> Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious
        alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.
