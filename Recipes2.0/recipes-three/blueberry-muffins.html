    <h2>Lightly sugared with beautiful muffin tops</h2>
    <p>This recipe was from Betty Crocker</p>
    <p>
      During the great depression money was scarce but, blueberries were
      plentiful. Betty first came up with the recipe when trying to feed her
      family a delicious yet affordable snack.
